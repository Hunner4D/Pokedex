## Pokdex

The function of a pokedex is to act as a dictionary for all pokemon.
In this project I created a visually simplistic one while grabbing data from the pokemon API

# Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, MONGODB, MONGOOSE, EXPRESS, NODE JS, OAUTH

# Additions To Be Made

This website will soon have more data transferred from the api, a sort functionality for "my pokemon", and will include handcrafted annotations
